BlocklyProp Launcher
====================

Introduction
------------

The BlocklyProp Launcher is a companion to the web-based BlocklyProp system - http://solo.parallax.com.

It loads your programs into the Parallax Propeller and creates a serial debugger connection from the browser
to the Propeller.


Requirements
------------

This system requires USB Serial Drivers in order to work properly with modern Propeller-based devices.  Install the
Parallax USB Drivers (included in the BlocklyProp Launcher Setup) before using this software.

Driver download.
